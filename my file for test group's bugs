Actions taken to fix:
I fix this code on 11/8/2022. I found five bugs in this code.
1- I removed (head) tag because we should not use it with the <script> tag.
2- I use space for indentation on the line 11.
3- I use special characters in line 26 because It miss it > for the body tag.
4- same problem in line 27, and I fix it. To use special characters in html tag like this >.
5- I paired the tag break with the close break.
