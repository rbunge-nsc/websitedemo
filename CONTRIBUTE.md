# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please keep all team members abreasts of your edits and/or alterations via Canvas email for our Intro to Software class, chaired by Robert.

## Code of Conduct
Our code of conduct is simple: don't be a jerk.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to NOT be a jerk and/or to-do what we tell our group/team we are going to-do.
### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*Not being a jerk

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Your Mama jokes....

### Our Responsibilities

We have a responsibility to treat our team/group project in the way that democracy should function - a majority rules. If group members don't participate and/or show up - they forefit their vote.
There is no formal veto process.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies with our group project.

### Enforcement

The only enforcement we'll be privy to is our own sense of guilt and/or remorse for being a jerk - if that occurs - I suspect - it won't.

### Attribution
