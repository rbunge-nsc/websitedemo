# IT115 Group 3 Class Project @ NSC
> We are Group 3. We learn git.

## Welcome
> In this project, we wanted to create a site that provides some helpful information on how to use git/GitHub. We hope you like it.

## Contributors (alphabetically by first name)

> 1. Amna Khider
> 2. Chris N
> 3. Joshua Gillen
> 4. Julyah G

## Environment Details
> As this is a webpage, the environment setup is up to you.
> Each team member is responsible for contributing to the production site using any Git/Github environment and local workflow they are most comfortable with.

## Submitting Changes
> We submit changes by:
> 1. creating a branch,
> 2. commiting and staging changes,
> 3. sending a pull request,
> 4. having a team member approve changes and merge changes.

## Testing
> We have a SuperLinter setup that will catch some code issues. Any bug that is caught here should be fixed before merging into main. Bugs found in main will be posted on the Bug Reports Board under Projects.
> Testing your code after an edit is a process that should be performed locally throughout development.

## Bug Reports
> Bugs are tracked here: [Bug Board](https://github.com/users/firejewels/projects/7/views/1)
This is how we make sure the team is aware of features that are missing or where the code needs a little work. All team members are resposible for posting and updating the board when an item needs to be closed.

## Code of Conduct
> Best Practice is to have a team member review your changes and pull requests and approve by merging the code into main.
> If a team member finds a bug when reviewing code, post it to the bug board and notify the author. Only merge clean code.
