            Lake Union is a freshwater lake in Seattle, Washington, USA. It is located in the northern part of the city and is surrounded by several neighborhoods, including Eastlake, Wallingford, and Fremont.

            The lake is popular for recreational activities such as boating, fishing, and kayaking. It is also home to several seaplane and boat rental companies.

            One of the most notable features of Lake Union is the Lake Union Loop, a 6.2-mile trail that circles the lake and offers scenic views of the water and the city skyline. The trail is popular among joggers, walkers, and cyclists.
