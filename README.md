# IT115 Group 3 Class Project @ NSC

## Project Overview
[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/firejewels/It115-Group-3-Project_sandbox/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

> We will use a fork of [websitedemo](https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/websitedemo) as the seed code for our project.
>
> The point of this project is to get hands on experience using Git/GitHub by collaborating with a group to create and launch a website (by reuseing, editing, modifying, deleting, or doing anything we want to with the forked seed code).
