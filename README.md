# Website_demo_It-115_Group 2
Demo website for the Cloud Core Curriculum
This is our North Seattle College IT-115 Software Development/Version control GROUP 2 project. 
We forked the the website demo and will edit text, images, content, and add features.
We'll also be adding our own Personal page(s) to the website.
This project is to give us better understanding of how to work together and collborate as team.
